- What it does: allows you to remotely power on network devices from an intranet site
- Prereqs: Need a basic understanding of IP, web servers and HTML/PHP, a running RPi and knowing how to use it
two parts: web server and the code itself
	code: I made some PHP/HTML/CSS to put on the server, that needs customization

1. Prep RPi
	[optional] create DNS entry to DNS server (usually your home router) to the wakeonlan machine
	or use DHCP with RPi and just use hostname that way
2. Move files over with pscp (wakelan.php and stylesheet.css)
3. install wakeonlan software package
4. Install apache and php
	- sudo apt-get install apache2 apache2-utils
	- sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-php5 php5 php-pear php5-xcache php5-mysql php5-curl php5-gd
5. Copy code and stylesheet to /var/www/html
	editing ownership of php/css files
		chown -R www-data: /var/www/html/
6. Edit file
	Change password to your liking, or remove it (if using password, do not re-use passwords from other places)
	Find and enter MAC addresses and PC descriptions
7. Enable WakeonLAN in the BIOS/UEFI of target systems
